\title{CSE 5194 WEEK14 - MPI}

\section{Deep learning with COTS HPC systems}
scaleup and scale out

Scale-up is done by adding more resources to an existing system to reach a desired state of performance

Scale-out is usually associated with distributed architectures

\subsection{contribution}
Implementation of a large--scale model-parallel training system for DNNs.

\subsection{Proposal}
Alternative approach to training such networks that with over 1 million

\subsection{Achieve scaling challenges}
commjunication bottlenecks; sofrware challenge: how to manage and design altorightm

4 - 8 we will face problems: cooling, commjunication;

\subsubsection{Implementation}
it solves:

requirehighly optimized GPU node for alll major compiar 

Computational overhead: $M * w*w*c$

with CUDA kernels: it requires expert knowledge of each gpu architecture.

\section{Second paper}
super large minibatch

RMS prop warmup: start the traing with RMS prop then gradually transition to SGD
