\subsection{BLoDB}
Why do we need HDFS at all:

normally you do not change the data;

the matrix parameters

want to save the trained data and checkpoint.

And large model won't fit in all data, so need a system.

And online traiing: very large dataset.


The perfroamnce is worse actuallly, but it's not taht worse, since the experiement using mnist and Softmax regression is little bit small.

tHE Actual benefit using this is to accommodate the existing big data framework.

And the performance difference will be less when the dataset is larger.

\subsection{BigDL}
major difference: it can run different frameworks direclty.'
