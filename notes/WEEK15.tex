\section{Speech}

\section{Co-design}
\paragraph{Strong copou and weak copoued}
Weak: treat as black box
String: C-caffe: strictly control runtime

\paragraph{The need for co-design}
One is slow;
Scaling out: 


\section{S-cafffe}
Co desinging MPOI runtimes and caffe for scalable deep learning on d=model gpu clusters

\subsection{CUDA}
First have to transfer data from local memory to GPU;
and need to givve back to CPU to exit;

What if move to the remote: to gpu; to cpu; to remote. can be done by the host;

Also, if there is a API, that cna direrctly move to the remote node;

make life easier for the framework (MPI) developer.

\paragraph{can directly read memory?}

DMA:RBMA: Network adaptor will do that for you

\subsection{mpi comminicator} hahaf

\subsection{research challenges}
bottleneckes for MPI runtimes;

\paragraph{co-design}
goal: overlap of compuation and comminicationm;
effieient large ;

\paragraph{S-Caffe basic}

See ppt.

\paragraph{SCOBR:}
MPI runtimes are unware of user's CUDA streems;

divide each buffer into N chunck and parallel.
